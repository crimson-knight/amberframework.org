# Documentation Version Configuration
#
# This file defines the available documentation versions and their inheritance chain.
# When a page doesn't exist in a version folder, the system falls back to the
# inherited version, allowing new versions to only contain changed/new documentation.
#
# Version folder naming:
#   - Use lowercase with hyphens: v1, v2-preview, v2
#   - Major versions: v1, v2, v3
#   - Preview/beta: v2-preview, v2-beta
#   - Release candidates: v2-rc1
#
# Status types:
#   - stable: Current recommended version
#   - preview: Upcoming version, may have incomplete docs
#   - deprecated: Old version, still accessible but not recommended
#   - archived: Very old, may be removed
#
# The default_version is shown when accessing /docs without a version specifier.
